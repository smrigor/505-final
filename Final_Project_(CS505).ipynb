        "\n",
        "In this project, I aimed to create a chatbot that would be a valuable resource to bilingual language learners that speak English and Spanish. While I initially attempted to train a ChatBot from the `chatterbot` package, I ultimately created a simplistic chatbot that takes menu options as inputs and returns different functions, such as dictionary lookup and vocabulary units. Though the chatbot has 3 functions, these functions are not fully implemented for both languages and require much more development before it could be released for practical use."

        "\n",
        "Although artificial intelligence has proven itself capable of generating art, essays, and scripts, many have yet to use natural language processing to develop new language technologies. Though improving existing tools like Google Translate and ChatGPT are helpful, these agents are not the most helpful or accessible for new language learners. As the Internet continues to connect users all over the world, it becomes more imperative that knowledge is accessible to all, and giving people the opportunity to learn a new language can aid in this endeavor.\n",
        "\n",
        "Outside of my computer science degree, I also study linguistics, in which I have learned of the importance of multilingualism and the impact that language has on our society. Between learning a new language in college and trying to speak to my parents in their native language I have experienced language barriers in its many forms, and I have longed for language learning tools that are both easy to use and easy to access. As I near graduation, I look forward to a future where I can use my knowledge of computer science and linguistics to aid in the development of language technology. With the love I have for both programming and language learning, I hope that a project like this can serve as a step on the way to providing better online resources for learners all over the world."

        "## Method & Results\n",
        "\n",
        "Originally, I only wanted to use `chatterbot` feature, but as I played around with the package, I found that the ChatBot returned strange responses, even when I changed the training data. Thus, I reverted to a simpler chatbot with menu options to choose from.\n",
        "\n",
        "To build this chatbot, I relied heavily on the Open Multilingual Wordnet package (`wordnet` and `omw`) to go back and forth between English and Spanish. Within WordNet, there are only 4 main categories of words: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. With that in mind, I had to make the language lessons within the ChatBot simple enough for language learners to understand as well as simple enough for WordNet to have an entry.\n",
        "\n",
        "To start, I looked up basic categories of words that people would expect to learn within the first few months of learning a second language. I then boiled down [this set of categories](https://www.towerofbabelfish.com/the-method/vocabulary/base-vocabulary-list/) down to colors, days of the week, months of the year, basic verbs, family, seasons, and travel.\n",
        "\n",
        "I then thought of different tools that would be best suited for new language learners, which resulted in the 3 main functions of the program: dictionary lookup, simple vocabulary units, and ChatBot practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the dictionary lookup, I utilized the existing functionality of WordNet— primarily the synset class and its methods that take in languages as parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the vocabulary units, I attempted to use the same functionality, but given that synsets give a long list of synonyms as translations, I wanted to make it simple for language learners by developing a function that only returns 1 translation per word. Thus, I tried to build a Spanish corpus using the online `.txt` version of _Don Quixote_ by cleaning the text of extraneous data and punctuation as well as ordering the words by usage. Ideally, the vocabulary function would have returned the most used translation for the given word.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, I gave one last effort at using `chatterbot` by creating a separate function outside of the `main()` program. If the user selects the third option (practice mode), the function will initiate a ChatBot trained on the target language. This involved creating a virtual environment with an older version of Python (3.7) to run `chatterbot`, creating a ChatBot based on the user's \"target language\" (the language being learned), and then using [existing chatterbox corpora](https://github.com/gunthercox/chatterbot-corpus) to train the bot. For both English and Spanish, I limited the data to more common topics like greetings, conversations, and sports.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Future Directions\n",
        "Unfortunately, I could not get `chatterbot` to work well. Initially, I tried to use a `ListTrainer` on the ChatBot and gave the trainer my own conversations to work off of. However, the chatbot was slow to learn these responses, if it even began learning them at all. Even when I used the standard `ChatterBotCorpusTrainer`, the chatbot would return strange responses, regardless of whether or not I removed those datapoints from its training data. In the future, it would be very worthwhile to upgrade `chatterbot` or develop another ChatBot package compatible with Jupyter Notebook as this package only works with Python 3.7 or older.\n",
        "\n",
        "Within the existing options, I did not have enough time to fully implement the Vocabulary Mode (mode 2) for both English and Spanish. If I had more time, I would have tried to further expand the \"most used\" translation idea. To get the best Spanish translation, I would have built a larger Spanish corpus (rather than just one novel). As for the English translation, I would have liked to use the Brown corpus as a model for most common English words and phrases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, I think a language learning tool like this would benefit from some sort of sentence generator. Because we learned a simpler way of sentences in HW03, I would have liked to create some sort of N-grams model for sentence generation given the basic words in the vocabulary sets. Learners could practice translating these sentences (similar to existing Duolingo activities) to practice their fluency. Alternatively, these sentences (and their translations) could be used as examples in the dictionary to help learners develop reading comprehension and understand words using context clues.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, a tool like this would be much more useful if I had expanded its reach to more languages in the WordNet database. With my own limited language knowledge, I was only able to create this project for English and Spanish— the prompts and menu options for each step of the way were translated by me in both languages, and I do not have the proficiency in any other language to do the same for more language options. If I knew a way to properly translate my prompts from English to every other language in the WordNet database, a tool like this would be revolutionary for NLTK and the low-resource language corpora."

        "\n",
        "While I enjoyed the work I made on this project, I believe there is much more to be accomplished before this tool could be beta-tested. This tool has some functionality for both word lookup and conversation practice, but it ultimately does not meet the standards of other resources online. That being said, though, this project was innovative in its attempt to combine multiple resources in one application. While most language learners would need to reference several different types of media to learn a given vocabulary unit, a finalized version of this project would make language  learning much simpler for people who do not know where to start. If I had the time and resources to explore the further directions mentioned above, I believe that this project would be extremely helpful for both language learners as well as fellow computer scientists and linguists working in natural language processing. The version I have now is just a start to the types of language technology I (and the rest of the NLP, MT, and computational linguistics communities) have yet to discover."
