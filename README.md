In the Fall 2023 semester, I took the Natural Language Processing course at Boston University. For my final project, I attempted to build a simple chatbot in Python that aimed to teach English to L1 Spanish speakers and Spanish to L1 English speakers. It used option menus to switch between languages as well as dictionary, practice, and lesson modes.
I edited this project using the Google Colaboratory IDE, and my Jupyter Notebook uses Python versions 3.10 and 3.7. Through this project, I worked with the NLTK platform (WordNet, Open Multilingual WordNet, Project Gutenberg) and the Chatterbot package.
Although this project still had its faults at the end of the course, it was the first time I attempted to build and train a chatbot, and I hope that I will have the time to fine-tune it as a personal project in the future.
